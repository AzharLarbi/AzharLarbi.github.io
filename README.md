# Data Analysis Project: Understanding the Relationship Between Yoga, Meditation, and Stress
Overview
This project aims to analyze data collected from interviews with 47 participants to explore the relationship between yoga, meditation, and stress levels. The primary focus is to understand whether age correlates with the practice of yoga and meditation, and how yoga may impact stress levels, particularly in the context of work-related stress.

# Data Analysis
# Age and Yoga/Meditation Practice
Correlation Analysis: Initially, I examined whether age correlates with the practice of yoga and meditation. However, due to the limited sample size and lack of age variation (participants aged between 16 and 32 with an average age of 20), the results may not be conclusive. This suggests a need for a larger and more diverse sample to draw more robust conclusions.

# Yoga Practice and Stress Levels
Impact of Yoga on Stress: Among participants who practiced yoga, I investigated their reported stress levels. Interestingly, many reported experiencing stress sometimes, indicating a potential relationship between work-related stress and engagement in yoga and meditation practices.

Perception of Yoga's Efficacy: Further analysis revealed that among those who practice yoga and experience work-related stress, a significant portion (17 out of the sample) believe that yoga helps alleviate their stress levels. This finding suggests that yoga may indeed serve as a coping mechanism for individuals dealing with work-related stress.

# Limitations
Small Sample Size: The primary limitation of this study is the small sample size of 47 participants, which limits the generalizability of the findings.

Limited Age Variation: The narrow age range of participants (16 to 32 years old) hinders the ability to draw conclusions about age-related trends in yoga and meditation practices.

# Future Directions
Expanded Sample: Future research should aim to collect data from a larger and more diverse sample to improve the generalizability of findings.

Inclusion of Demographic Variables: Including additional demographic variables such as occupation, gender, and socioeconomic status can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing yoga, meditation, and stress levels.

Longitudinal Studies: Longitudinal studies tracking individuals over time can offer insights into the causal relationships between yoga practice, stress levels, and other variables.

Scientific Data: Inluding measured data in stress level and even EEG data to indicate how much yoga in fact reduced stress. 

# Conclusion
Despite the limitations, this project sheds light on the potential relationship between yoga, meditation, and stress levels, particularly in the context of work-related stress. While the findings are preliminary, they underscore the importance of further research in this area to better understand the mechanisms through which yoga and meditation may impact stress management.
